	abstract = {It has recently been shown that authenticated Byzantine agreement, in which more than a third of the parties are corrupted, cannot be securely realized under concurrent or parallel (stateless) composition. This result puts into question any usage of authenticated Byzantine agreement in a setting where many executions take place. In particular, this is true for the whole body of work of secure multi-party protocols in the case that a third or more of the parties are corrupted. This is because these protocols strongly rely on the extensive use of a broadcast channel, which is in turn realized using authenticated Byzantine agreement. We remark that it was accepted folklore that the use of a broadcast channel (or authenticated Byzantine agreement) is actually essential for achieving meaningful secure multi-party computation whenever a third or more of the parties are corrupted. In this paper we show that this folklore is false. We present a mild relaxation of the deﬁnition of secure computation allowing abort. Our new deﬁnition captures all the central security issues of secure computation, including privacy, correctness and independence of inputs. However, the novelty of the deﬁnition is in decoupling the issue of agreement from these issues. We then show that this relaxation suﬃces for achieving secure computation in a point-to-point network. That is, we show that secure multi-party computation for this deﬁnition can be achieved for any number of corrupted parties and without a broadcast channel (or trusted preprocessing phase as required for running authenticated Byzantine agreement). Furthermore, this is achieved by just replacing the broadcast channel in known protocols with a very simple and eﬃcient echo-broadcast protocol. An important corollary of our result is the ability to obtain multi-party protocols that remain secure under composition, without assuming a broadcast channel.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a simpler and more restricted variant of the universally composable security (UC) framework that is suitable for “standard” two-party and multiparty computation tasks. Many of the complications of the UC framework exist in order to enable more general tasks than classic secure computation. This generality may be a barrier to entry for those who are used to the stand-alone model of secure computation and wish to work with universally composable security but are overwhelmed by the diﬀerences. The variant presented here (called simpliﬁed universally composable security, or just SUC) is closer to the deﬁnition of security for multiparty computation in the stand-alone setting. The main diﬀerence is that a protocol in the SUC framework runs with a ﬁxed set of parties who know each other’s identities ahead of time, and machines cannot be added dynamically to the execution. As a result, the deﬁnitions of polynomial time and protocol composition are much simpler. In addition, the SUC framework has authenticated channels built in, as is standard in previous deﬁnitions of security, and all communication is done via the adversary in order to enable arbitrary scheduling of messages. Due to these diﬀerences, not all cryptographic tasks can be expressed in the SUC framework. Nevertheless, standard secure computation tasks (like secure function evaluation) can be expressed. Importantly, we show a natural security-preserving transformation from protocols in the SUC model to protocols in the full-ﬂedged UC model. Consequently, the UC composition theorem holds in the SUC model, and any protocol that is proven secure under SUC can be transformed to a protocol that is secure in the UC model.},

We provide answers to this question for a number of diﬀerent settings (i.e., considering perfect versus statistical security, and concurrent composition with adaptive versus ﬁxed inputs). Our results enhance the understanding of what is necessary for obtaining security under composition, as well as providing tools (i.e., composition theorems) that can be used for proving the security of protocols under composition while considering only the standard stand-alone deﬁnitions of security.},

While Drijvers et al. proposed a secure two-round scheme, this eﬃciency in terms of rounds comes with the price of having signatures that are more than twice as large as Schnorr signatures, which are becoming popular in cryptographic systems due to their practicality (e.g., they will likely be adopted in Bitcoin). If one needs a multi-signature scheme that can be used as a drop-in replacement for Schnorr signatures, then one is forced to resort either to a three-round scheme or to sequential signing sessions, both of which are undesirable options in practice.},

Although the homomorphic commitment schemes in the literature can be used to achieve this goal, the sizes of their commitments are linear in the degree of the committed polynomial. On the other hand, polynomial commitments in our schemes are of constant size (single elements). The overhead of opening a commitment is also constant; even opening multiple evaluations requires only a constant amount of communication overhead. Therefore, our schemes are useful tools to reduce the communication cost in cryptographic protocols. On that front, we apply our polynomial commitment schemes to four problems in cryptography: veriﬁable secret sharing, zero-knowledge sets, credentials and content extraction signatures.},

However, there is a troubling disconnect between the stand-alone security of such a protocol and its security as part of a larger, more complex system where several protocols may be running at the same time. Provable security in the general universal composition (GUC) model of Canetti et al. is the best guarantee that nothing will go wrong when a system is part of a larger whole, even when all parties share a common random oracle. In this paper, we prove the minimal necessary properties of generally universally composable (GUC-secure) NIZKPoK in any global random-oracle model, and show how to achieve efficient and GUC-secure NIZKPoK in both the restricted programmable and restricted observable (non-programmable) global random-oracle models.},

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (ZK-PoK) for discrete logarithms and related problems are indispensable for practical cryptographic protocols. At Eurocrypt 2009, Camenisch, Kiayias, and Yung provided a speciﬁcation language (the CKY-language) for such protocols, which allows one to modularly design and analyze cryptographic protocols: protocol designers just need to specify the statement they want to prove in zero-knowledge and are ensured that an eﬃcient proof protocol exists and indeed proves the speciﬁed statement, provided that the speciﬁcation was in the CKY-language.},

	abstract = {Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are a powerful cryptographic primitive used in privacypreserving protocols. We design and build C∅C∅, the ﬁrst system enabling developers to build eﬃcient, composable, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for generic, user-deﬁned statements. C∅C∅ extends state-of-the-art SNARK constructions by applying known strengthening transformations to yield UC-composable zero-knowledge proofs suitable for modular use in larger cryptographic protocols.},
