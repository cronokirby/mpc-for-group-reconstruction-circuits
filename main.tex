\section{Introduction}

\todo{Write the introduction}

\section{Background}

Throughout this paper, we let $\G$ denote a group of prime order $q$,
with generators $G$ and $H$. Let $\Fq$ denote the scalar field associated
with this group, and let $\Zq$ denote the additive group of elements
in this field.

We make heavy use of group homomorphisms throughout this paper.
We let
$$
\varphi(P_1, \ldots, P_m) : \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}
$$
denote a homomorphism from $\mathbb{A}$ to $\mathbb{B}$, parameterized
by some public values $P_1, \ldots, P_m$. Commonly $\mathbb{A}$
will be a product of several groups $\mathbb{G}_1, \ldots, \mathbb{G}_n$,
in which case we'd write:
$$
\varphi(P_1, \ldots, P_m)(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
$$
to denote the application of $\varphi$ to an element $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$
of the product group. We also often leave the public values $P_i$ implicit.

\subsection{Maurer's \texorpdfstring{$\varphi$}{varphi}-Proof}

In \cite{maurer_unifying_2009}, Maurer generalized Schnorr's sigma 
protocol for knowledge of the discrete logarithm \todo{cite} to a much larger class
of relations. In particular, Maurer provided a sigma protocol for
proving knowledge of the pre-image of a group homomorphism $\varphi$.
We denote this protocol as a ``$\varphi$-proof'', and recapitulate the scheme
here.
